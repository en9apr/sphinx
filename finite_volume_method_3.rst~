Spatial Discretisation
======================

Types of Spatial Discretisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FVM can handle any type of spatial discretisation

For the same mesh we can have different definitions of the control volumes:

Cell-centred scheme
--------------------

* Control volumes are identical with the grid cells
* Flow variables are located at the centres of grid cells - :math:`u_{i,j}` is an average
* Grid lines define control volume surfaces

Vertex-centred scheme
---------------------

Cell-vertex scheme
------------------

* Control volume is 4 cells that share the grid point :math:`i,j`
* Control volumes may overlap

Hexagonal control volume scheme
-------------------------------

Trapezoidal control volume scheme
---------------------------------

For a Consistent Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The sum of all CVs should cover the entire domain
2) The sub-domains :math:`\Omega_J` are allowed to overlap, as long as each portion of the surface :math:`S_J` have to appear as a part of an **even** number of different surfaces - so that the fluxes cancel out, e.g. 2 surfaces, 4 surfaces etc.
3) Computing fluxes along a cell surface has to be independent of the cell in which they are considered - **ensures that conservation is satisfied**

Numerical Discretisation
========================

Apply integral conservation law to subvolumes (:math:`\Omega_J` = subvolume)

.. math:: {\partial \over \partial t} \int_{\Omega_J} U d \Omega + 
          \oint_{\Omega_J} \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{S} = 
          \int_{\Omega_J} Q d \Omega
