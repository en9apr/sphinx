The Navier-Stokes Equations

$$ {\partial \vec V \over \partial t} + \vec V (\nabla \cdot \vec V) = -{\nabla p \over \rho} + \nu \nabla^2 \vec V $$

$$\text{Unsteady term + Convective term = Pressure gradient term + Viscous term}$$

**4.1.1** Assumed a Newtonian Fluid - shear stress proportional to strain

**4.1.2** Assumed incompressible flow - density constant

**4.1.3** $\vec V (\nabla \cdot \vec V)$ the convective term is also the non-linear term

**4.1.4** $\nu \nabla^2 \vec V$ the viscous term is also is the 2nd order term

**4.1.5** The momentum equation in the Navier Stokes Equations is a 2nd order, non-linear partial differential equation

**4.1.6** If the fluid is inviscid $ \nu = 0$. Then we have the Euler Equations. But it's still non-linear:

$$ {\partial \vec V \over \partial t} + \vec V (\nabla \cdot \vec V) = -{\nabla p \over \rho} $$

**4.1.7** What is a solution? 

*4.1.7.1* The velocity field (vector)

*4.1.7.2* The associated pressure field (scalar)

###4.2 Why do we Need CFD?###

**4.2.1** There are very few known analytical solutions to the Navier Stokes Equations, e.g. when the convective term goes to zero, when there is flow in a pipe, flow between parallel plates and flow between concentric circles.

**4.2.2** Systems may be difficult to test through experimentation - e.g. experiment doesn't allow us to see inside or the instrumentation is limited, or it's dangerous to do the experiment.

**4.2.3** Faster and easier than experiment - CFD allows us to ask "what if" questions about a situation. Don't have to build prototype.

**4.2.4** CFD can be used in animation for movies

###4.3 Components of a CFD Model###

####4.3.1 Mathematical Model####

*4.3.1.1* A set of partial differential equations or integral-differential equations

*4.3.1.2* Associated boundary conditions

*4.3.1.3* The non linearity is a source of turbulence, vorticity, shock waves, combustion, multi-phase, bubble dynamics, evapouration, condensation.

*4.3.1.4* Model is assciated with a target application - e.g. incompressible, inviscid, turbulent, 2D or 3D model

####4.3.2 Discretization Method - the major part of CFD####

*4.3.2.1* Method for approximating the partial differential equations or the integral-differential equations by a system of algebraic equations.

*4.3.2.2* We have a PDE $$ \mathcal{L} [u(\underline{x})] = f(\underline{x})$$

*4.3.2.3* Convert to arithmetic $$A\underline{x} = \underline{b}$$

*4.3.2.4* The most important methods are:

4.3.2.4.1 Finite Difference (1950s)

4.3.2.4.2 Finite Element (1960s)

4.3.2.4.3 Spectral Methods (1970s)

4.3.2.4.4 Finite Volume (1980s)

4.3.2.4.5 Boundary Element

4.3.2.4.6 Particle Methods.

*4.3.2.5* Two aspects: 

4.3.2.5.1 The Geometry (grid or mesh or particles) - gives us a vessel for the solution

4.3.2.5.2 The Model - all mathematical operators converted into arithmetic operations on grid

####4.3.3 Analyse Numerical Scheme####

*4.3.3.1* All numerical schemes must satisfy certain conditions to be accepted - consistency, stability, convergence.

*4.3.3.2* Must analyse accuracy

####4.3.4 Solve####

*4.3.4.1* Obtain grid/point values of all flow variables

*4.3.4.2* Time dependent = ODEs or steady = algebraic system of equations

*4.3.4.3* Time integrators

*4.3.4.4* Linear solvers

####4.3.5 Post Processing####

*4.3.5.1* Visualization
