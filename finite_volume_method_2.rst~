Definition of a Conservation Law
================================

Recall - what is a conservation law?

"Conservation means the **variation** of a conserved (intensive) flow quantity within a given volume is due to the **net effect** of some **internal sources** and the amount of that quantity which is **crossing the boundary surface**"

Essentially we are looking at the net effect of:

* Sources
* Fluxes

How to Identify Fluxes
----------------------

* Fluxes appear exclusively under the **gradient operator** - the flux is the only spatial derivative that appears in the equation

* This is a way to recognise if flux is conserved - **look at the gradient operator** - can you group the spatial derivatives under a gradient operator, so that the fluxes have **divergence** - i.e. a measure of "outgoingness"?

* In conservative form, we usually have **mass flux**, **momentum flux** and **total energy flux**

How to Identify Sources
-----------------------

* Sources are usually scalars in one direction and don't usually have divergence, e.g. **gravity**, **pressure gradient**

Differential Discretisation
===========================

* The differential form requires the fluxes to be **differentiable** - this is not always satisfied, this may introduce impossible solutions.

* Discontinuities introduce infinite gradient, e.g.

 - shocks in the flow
 - a free surface
 - a slip line behind a trailing edge

Conservative Discretisation

General Form of a Conservation Law
----------------------------------

.. math:: {{\partial \over \partial t} \int_{\Omega} U d \Omega} + \oint_{S} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_{\Omega} Q d \Omega

where:

:math:`\Omega =` volume

:math:`S =` surface

:math:`U =` quantity

:math:`F =` flux vector

:math:`Q =` source

i.e. the quantity :math:`U` only depends on the **surface values** of the fluxes

Conservative Discretisation
---------------------------

:math:`\Omega` divided into :math:`\Omega_1`, :math:`\Omega_2` and :math:`\Omega_3`:

For each subvolume:

.. math:: {{\partial \over \partial t} \int_{\Omega_1} U d \Omega} + \oint_{ABCA} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_{\Omega_1} Q d \Omega

.. math:: {{\partial \over \partial t} \int_{\Omega_2} U d \Omega} + \oint_{DEBD} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_{\Omega_2} Q d \Omega


.. math:: {{\partial \over \partial t} \int_{\Omega_3} U d \Omega} + \oint_{AEDA} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_{\Omega_3} Q d \Omega

Notice that the contribution of the **internal fluxes**, cancel each other out when summated in each direction. Hence the numerical scheme is **conservative** in the way it treats the flux terms.

Example of Conservative Discretisation
--------------------------------------

Consider a 1D conservation law in conservative form:

.. math:: {\partial u \over \partial t} + {\partial f \over \partial x} = q

Associate a finite "cell" to each mesh point, e.g. cell (i) has two "cell faces" at the mid-points :math:`i-{1 \over 2}` and :math:`i+{1 \over 2}`
