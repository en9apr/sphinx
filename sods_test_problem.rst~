Sod's Test Problems: The Shock Tube Problem
===========================================

This set of problems was introduced in the paper by Gary Sod in 1978 called "A Survey of Several Finite Difference Methods for Systems of Nonlinear Hyperbolic Conservation Laws"

Assumptions
===========

* 1D
* Infinitely long tube
* Inviscid fluid

Initial Conditions
==================

.. figure:: _images/IC_sod.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%

* At t=0 the diaphragm is instantanesouly removed (this is done experimentally using a a thin sheet of metal and a small explosion bursts the diaphragm)

Regions of Flow
===============

* The bursting of the diaphragm causes a 1D unsteady flow consisting of a steadily moving **shock** - A Riemann Problem.
* 1 discontonuity is present 
* The solution is self-similar with 5 regions

* Region 1 & 5 - left and right sides of initial states
* Region 2 - expansion or rarefaction wave (x-dependent state)
* Regions 3 & 4 - steady states independent of x within the region (uniform)

Contact line between 3 and 4 separates fluids of different entropy (but they have the same pressure and velocity) i.e. it's an invisible line - e.g. two fluids one side with water and the other with dye - contact line is moving.
