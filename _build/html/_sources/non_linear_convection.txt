Understand the Problem
======================

* What is the final velocity profile for 1D non-linear convection when the initial conditions are a square wave and the boundary conditions are constant?

* 1D non-linear convection is described as follows:

.. math:: {\partial u \over \partial t} + u {\partial u \over \partial x} = 0

* This equation is capable of generating discontinuities (shocks)

Conclusions
===========

Why isn't the square wave maintained?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The first order backward differencing scheme in space still creates false diffusion as before.
* However, due to the non-linearity in the governing equation, if the spatial step is reduced, the solution can develop shocks, see Figure 2.
* Clearly a square wave is not best represented with the invisid Burgers Equation.

Why does the wave shift to the right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The square wave is being convected by the velocity, `u` which is not constant.
* The greatest shift is where the velocity is greatest, see Figure 1

What happens at the wall?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* As there is no viscosity, there is a non-physical change in the profile near the wall, see Figure 3.
* Comparing this with the linear example, there is clearly much more numerical diffusion in the non-linear example, perhaps due to the convective term being larger, causing a greater magnitude in numerical diffusion.
