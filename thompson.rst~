Abstract
========

A variant of reverse roll coating is studied via:

* Experimental
* Analytical (lubriation)
* Computational (finite element)

Experimental results:

* Flow rate and wetting line position over range of roll speed ratios and capillary numbers
* Provided the wetting line is suffciently far from the nib, the flow rate depends linearly on reservoir level

What is unique about this study:

* Variation of dynamic contact angle with metering roll speed has been accounted for

Lubriation model boundary conditions:

* Free surface
* Surface tension
* Wetting line effects 

Physics:

* The effect of gravity is influential
* Flow in the reservoir is recirculating in nature
* The size and number of recirculations depends on reservoir geometry

Good agreement between models and experimental data

Introduction
============

Rigid-roll coating systems operating in reverse mode are used for applying thin liquid films, in the production of:

* Magnetic media
* Adhesive tapes
* Films
* Foils

Types of rigid-roll coating systems:

* Pan-fed
* Direct-fed

Physics:

* Flow in the **positive metering gap** between the co-rotating applicator and metering rolls plays a crucial role in determining the **final wet film thickness trasferred to the substrate**

Discrepancy between FE model and experiment:

* Neglect of gravity
* Absence of dynamic wetting line

Discrepancy between lubrication model and experiment:

* At high speed ratio and capillary number
* Importance of the position of the dynamic wetting line relative to the nip - w.r.t onset of cascade instability

Other effects:

* Effect of feed condition on the flow structure

Direct-fed reverse roll coating is investigated. The web thickness is determined by:

* Competition between metering action of the reverse roll configuration
* Influence of gravity in the form of hydrostatic head provided by the reservoir

Aim of this paper
-----------------

Quantify the effect of the reservoir on:

* The coated film thickness
* Dynamic wetting line position


Experimental Method
===================

A rig was designed to:

* Retain the important features of the industrial model
* Be flexible in operation
* Allow optical access

Conditions:

* Large bank of liquid ensured that ambient temperature changes did not affect liquid properties
* 0.5kg weight was applied to the hosing of the tank to seat it on the rolls
* Doctor blade used to remove any residue

Fluid:

* Newtonian mineral oil
* Surface tension measured with a torsion balance
* Viscosity measured with a viscometer
* Density measured by measuring the mass of a known volume of fluid

Visualisation:

* Liquid illuminated
* Illumination of nip region achieved using a mirror
* Flow patterns recorded on a video system via a microscope and CCD camera

Flow visualisation

Results
=======

Variables of interest:

* Flow rate
* Wetting line position is useful w.r.t cascade instability when it migrates upstream of the nip


Conclusions
===========

1) This is a study of the equilibrium flow in a variant of reverse roll coating, where the metering gap sits beneath a large reservoir

2) Experimental data shows:

* If wetting line is sufficiently far downstream of the nip: flow rate increases **linearly** with reservoir level
* If wetting line is close to the nip: effect of level on flow rate is **non-linear** and influences the onset of the **cascade instability**

3) Hydrodynamic model:

* Dynamic contact angle with metering roll speed is incorperated using a hydrodynamic model for wetting. 
* However, data is lacking for the hydrodynamic model, so a calibration method is proposed, in terms of the interfacial layer thickness.
* This interfacial layer thickness is calibrated by matching the prediction against theory for one data point only.

4) FE solutions can predict accuractely:

* Flow rate
* Wetting line positions (even at high Capillary Numbers)

5) Lubrication model predicts the flow rate over a range of Capillary Numbers, however:

* Wetting line prediction is sensitive to the way the free surface is represented
* Free surface profile should be represented by a parabolic rather than a circular arc
* But the lubrication prediction demonstrates the benefit of incorperating the effects of free surface, surface tension and the wetting line - especially the abiility to predict the flow rate mininum casued by wetting line migration through the nip

6) Experimental results vs FE solutions show good comparison

7) Flow in reservoir should not be overlooked - given the possiblity of recirculations there
