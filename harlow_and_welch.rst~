Introduction
============

* New technique for numerical solution of free surface problems, designated the "Marker and Cell Method"

* Physical assumptions:

1) Time dependent motion
2) Viscous
3) Incompressible
4) 2D with **Cartesian Coordinates**
5) Uniform body force (gravity) may act on the fluid

* Possible boundary conditions:

1) Wall boundaries for an **irregular box**
2) Lines of reflective symmetry
3) Prescribed pressure may be applied to the surface - **variable in position and time**

* Method uses:

1) Finite difference method
2) Full Navier Stokes Equations
