Problem with Upwind Scheme
==========================

Upwind scheme is 1st order accurate, which creates numerical diffusion.

Quick Scheme
============

To address this, B.P. Leonard (1979) introduced the "Quadratic Interpolation for Convective Kinetics" scheme (QUICK)

QUICK uses a 3-point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation for the cell face values

Example in 1D:
