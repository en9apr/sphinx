Python Basics
==============

Python is a high-level open-source language. This page is written with the **use** of Python in mind, as opposed to computer science definitions.

Modules
=======

* Modules provide useful functions, such as array operations, plotting and much more.
* We can import the module to allow access to the functions 

.. testcode::
   
   # comments in python are denoted by the hash tag
   import numpy as np # for matrix operations
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for 2D plotting
