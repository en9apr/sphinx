Finite Difference Formulas in 2D
================================

Extend 1D formulas to 2D
========================

* Just apply the definition of a partial derivative w.r.t. :math:`x` is the variation in :math:`x` holding :math:`y` constant

* Build 2D grid defined by the following:

* For i between :math:`0` and :math:`nx-1`:

.. math::

   x_i = x_0 + i \Delta x

* For j between :math:`0` and :math:`nj-1`:
 
.. math::

   y_j = y_0 + j \Delta y

   :scale: 75%
   :align: center

* Define :math:`u_{i,j} = u(x_i,y_j)`

* For the point :math:`(i+1,j+1)`, Taylor series in 2D:
