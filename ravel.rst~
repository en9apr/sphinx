Where is this study placed within the wave modelling community?
===============================================================

* This study is in the category of models attemping to solve the problem of non-linear wave effects in shallow water. 
* It takes the approach of deterministic (phase resolving) wave modelling in the time domain.
* It uses one phase per realisation, and seven realisations are performed (which may have been limited by the large computing time needed) but at different depths and frequencies.
* Unlike other models in this category, it also includes viscous effects, which allows energy decay rate to be observed, which is one of the open questions in this field.
* It also postulates various mechanisms for this decay rate, to try to explain the physics behind the energy decay rate difference between intermediate and deep water cases.

Assumptions
===========

1) 2D
2) Viscous fluid
3) Non-linear
4) Non-breaking
5) Intermediate and deep water - with a slope
6) Zero wind velocity - air follows wind

Determine
=========

1) Velocity field
2) Streamlines
3) Vorticity
4) Shear stress

Findings
========

Near the water surface:

1) Clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of the fluid at the trough and crest
2) Thicker vorticity layers and larger magnitude of vorticity compared with:

 * Inviscid, rotational flow (the Gerstner wave)
 * Low Re viscous flow (from Kinsman (1965) and Lamb (1932))

3) Thick shear layer with larger shear stress (-ve and +ve shear stress below crest and troughs of the wave)
4) Good comparison between wave energy decay rates (numerical, experimental and theoretical)

Literature Review
=================

3 categories of techniques:

1) Potential flow - inviscid, irrotational, no turbulence (analytical solution via Laplace equation for velocity potential plus boundary conditions):

   * Inaccurate for flows with a boundary layer (e.g. atmospheric boundary layer, bottom boundary layer)
   * Vorticity is zero, so fluid loses it's infinite degrees of freedom (so the fluid ceases to be a fluid in reality)

2) Inviscid rotational flow:

   * Gersther's trochodial wave theory
   * Boundary integral method - periodic and solitary waves with constant vorticity - limited due to special application of vorticity distribution
   * Boundary integral method - interaction of small amplitude waves with bottom ripples

3) Viscous flow:

   * Kinsman and Lamb (low Re): No convection terms, which linearizes the Navier Stokes Equations, such that an analytical solution can be found
   * Behroozi: conservation of energy for fluid viscosity and decay relation
   * Wang & Joseph: viscous potential flow and viscous correction potential flow for decay of free gravity wave due to viscosity
   * Dutykh & Dias: Visco-potential free surface flow
 
What kind of numerical methods are there?
-----------------------------------------

1) Front tracking method
2) Boundary integral method
3) Phase field method
4) Second gradient method
5) Level set method
6) Marker and cell methoed
7) Smooth particle hydrodynamics
8) Finite analytic method and modified marker and cell method, using zero shear stress atthe surface for velocity and energy decay rate
