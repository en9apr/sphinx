Comments on the 12 Steps to Navier Stokes
=========================================

* We have really used the simplest possible methods for the 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes

* These methods are unsuitable for practical purposes, because of diffusion e.g. the use of **1st order upwinding (BD in space)** for the convection term in the momentum equation for example.

* We must now develop new methods that are higher order methods.

Stability and Convergence, Modified Differential Equation and Truncation Error
==============================================================================

* For 1D convection, CD in space with FD in time produced a **Modified Differential Equation**, which was not a **convection equation**, but a **convection-diffusion equation** with a negative diffusion coefficient (helping to explain why the scheme was unstable).
