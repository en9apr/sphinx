New Schemes for Convection
==========================

Leapfrog Scheme
---------------

**For linear convection** the schemes we have considered so far are:

* Unconditionally unstable (1st order FD in time, **2nd order CD in space**)
* Introduce numerical diffusion (1st order FD in time, **1st order BD in space**)

For demonstrations of this, see numerical_scheme_1_

.. _numerical_scheme_1: http://www.thevisualroom.com/numerical_scheme_1.html

For linear convection, our scheme has been only 1st order in space and time, i.e.

.. math:: {{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n} \over {\Delta t}} + c {{u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n} \over \Delta x}=0 
 
For the leapfrog scheme, both space and time are discretised by 2nd order CD formulas

.. math:: {{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^{n-1}} \over {2 \Delta t}} + c {{u_{i-1}^n - u_{i-1}^n} \over {2 \Delta x}}=0 

i.e.

.. math:: u_i^{n+1} = u_i^{n+1} - {{c \Delta t} \over \Delta x} (u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n) 

.. math:: u_i^{n+1} = u_i^{n+1} - \sigma (u_{i+1}^n - u_{i-1}^n) 

where the CFL number is :math:`\sigma =  {{c \Delta t} \over \Delta x}`
