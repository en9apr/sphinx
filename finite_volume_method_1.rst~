About the Finite Difference Method
==================================

* Could try Euler Equations using Finite Difference Method

Reason for Not Implementing Finite Volume Method in Python
==========================================================

* Finite Volume Method gets most of it's advantages from being used on unstructured meshes - lots of bookeeping in order to show Finite Volume vs Finite Difference **Question: except in 1D e.g. Godunov's method?**

Finite Volume Method Advantages
===============================

* No requirements on the grid to be **structured** - suitable for complex geometries. Structured means:

.. figure:: _images/grid.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%
